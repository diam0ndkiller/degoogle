# Recommended FOSS apps on Android
When going the FOSS route on your android phone, you will have to use a lot of new apps in your daily use. Here are my favorites.
## SimpleMobileTools
Like mentioned in the first guide, the [SimpleMobileTools](https://simplemobiletools.com) suite has a full-feature replacement for all your default phone activities available in F-Droid, including:
- Simple Dialer (for phone calls)
- Simple SMS Messenger
- Simple Contacts
- Simple Camera
- Simple Gallery Pro
- Simple Notes Pro
- Simple Calendar
- Simple Clock (Widgets and Timers / Alarms)
- Simple App Launcher
- Simple Launcher (Home screen, not my favorite choice)
- Simple Calculator
- Simple Music Player
- Simple File Manager Pro
- Simple Keyboard (not best choice however)
- Simple Voice Recorder
- and even Simple Flashlight
These apps are the perfect replacement for any default Google app, having all necessary features with no tracking in sight!
## InnerTune
[This app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.zionhuang.music/) I use all the time. It is a FOSS client for listening to music, available on F-Droid. Although it uses the YouTube Music library in the background it's completely non-connected to anything else from Google. It is totally free and has no ads, so the perfect replacement for Spotify.
It supports downloading songs, creating and downloading playlists and showing live lyrics for most songs, with active development resulting in more features to come soon!
## LocalSend
This little app is the best replacement for any file-sharing, replacing AirDrop, NearbyShare together by being Cross-Platform. [LocalSend](https://localsend.org) is available on F-Droid and can also be downloaded for iOS, Windows, MacOS and Linux. It makes sharing files via WiFi networks as easy as two clicks!
## NewPipe
[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net) is a Lightweight YouTube-Client for android, also available on F-Droid. Although there are a lot of FOSS video platforms, Google's YouTube is still unbeatable. So this app creates a de-googled experience for YouTube, without any ads and no account needed!
## K-9 Mail
This is a mail client available on F-Droid. It has all the features you might want, except for notifications. But for having your mails on your PC normally, it's perfect. get [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.app)!
## Xtra
If you want to watch live streams on Twitch, you can use [Xtra](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.andreyasadchy.xtra/). This is a clean little player for Twitch, with account integration and live chat. So all the features you need!
## Keyboard
Like said earlier, the orange Simple Keyboard from SimpleMobileTools isn't my favorite, I would recommend the same-named [Simple Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/rkr.simplekeyboard.inputmethod) because it has a better special character layout for normal use.
## Maps
The hardest bit to replace is Google Maps. To this day, I still have a Google Maps Webapp through Firefox on my phone. If you don't want to search for locations, you can use [Open Map](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.osmdroid). This one only shows maps, but for that it's perfect. Open Map downloads maps online when you have internet and makes them available offline later. If you need to find specific places or have a route planner, you can either use [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) in your browser or use a Google Maps Webapp. However, these are both online, so you should have enough mobile data to stream a map.
## LibreOffice Viewer
The last FOSS app I would recommend is [LibreOffice Viewer](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.documentfoundation.libreoffice). This one lets your phone display (but not edit) OpenDocumentFormat and Microsoft Office files, if someone expects you to read them.
## Other Apps
I believe, you are now set for a while and can find other apps on F-Droid or if non-FOSS on Aurora for your daily use.
## non-FOSS recommendations:
### Signal
Although not in F-Droid by default, this app is a privacy-focused replacement for the WhatsApp messenger.
### Nova Launcher
This is a highly customizable launcher (home screen), available on Google Play, so get it via Aurora.
