# Result of de-Googling your phone
On this emulated Google Pixel 3a I have removed all Google Software and installed FOSS and other alternatives instead. In just half an hour there were no traces of Google left. Instead, there is almost the entire SimpleMobileTools suite installed. Additionally, I have
- **NewPipe** for watching YouTube
- **InnerTune** for listening to music
- **LocalSend** for sharing files
- **K-9 Mail** for managing E-Mails
- **Xtra** for viewing Twitch streams
- the **LibreOffice Viewer** for opening documents and
- **SimpleKeyboard** (not the SimpleMobileTools version) as a replacement for Gboard installed.

Also, as you can see, I have Canta and Shizuku installed. With those I have uninstalled every Google app, which would not be possible in the normal settings. Also, I had to use an adb shell to uninstall the Google Calendar, no idea why. But that worked no problem. The non-FOSS app on this device are
- **HERE We Go** for navigation
- the **Nova Launcher** as a replacement for the default Pixel Launcher home screen and
- **dynamicSpot**, an app to emulate Apple's Dynamic Island when recieving a notification.

All of them are installed via the Aurora Store and I can't recommend them enough :). Read more about all of these apps [here](https://github.com/diam0ndkiller/degoogle/blob/main/foss%20apps.md)
Here you can see all the installed SimpleMobileTools. With the ability to change every single app icon color I think they look A LOT better than the Google apps.
