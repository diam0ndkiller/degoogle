# Result of de-Googling your phone
On this emulated Google Pixel 3a I have removed all Google Software and installed FOSS and other alternatives instead. In just half an hour there were no traces of Google left.

Now there is almost the entire [SimpleMobileTools](https://simplemobiletools.com) suite installed and with the ability of changing every single app icon color I think they look A LOT better than the Google apps. Additionally, I have **NewPipe** for watching YouTube, **InnerTune** for listening to music, **LocalSend** for sharing files, **K-9 Mail** for managing E-Mails, **Xtra** for viewing Twitch streams, the **LibreOffice Viewer** for opening documents and **SimpleKeyboard** (not the SimpleMobileTools version) as a replacement for Gboard. Also, as you can see, I have Canta and Shizuku installed. With those I have uninstalled every Google app, which would not be possible in the normal settings. Also, I had to use an adb shell to uninstall the Google Calendar, no idea why. But that worked no problem. The non-FOSS app on this device are **HERE We Go** for navigation, the **Nova Launcher** as a replacement for the default Pixel Launcher home screen and **dynamicSpot**, an app to emulate Apple's Dynamic Island when recieving a notification. All of them are installed via the Aurora Store and I can't recommend them enough :). Read more about all of these apps [here](https://github.com/diam0ndkiller/degoogle/blob/main/foss%20apps.md)
