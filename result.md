# Result of de-Googling your phone
On an emulated Google Pixel 3a I have removed all Google Software and installed FOSS and other alternatives instead. In just half an hour there were no traces of Google's tracking left!
## Installd apps
### FOSS Apps
Currently, there is almost the entire SimpleMobileTools suite installed. Additionally, I have
- **NewPipe** for watching YouTube
- **InnerTune** for listening to music
- **LocalSend** for sharing files
- **K-9 Mail** for managing E-Mails
- **Xtra** for viewing Twitch streams
- the **LibreOffice Viewer** for opening documents and
- **SimpleKeyboard** (not the SimpleMobileTools version) as a replacement for Gboard installed.

All of these are installed via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)
### non-FOSS apps
Also, as you can see, I have Canta and Shizuku installed. With those I have uninstalled every Google app, which would not be possible in the normal settings. Also, I had to use an adb shell to uninstall the Google Calendar, no idea why. But that worked no problem. The non-FOSS app on this device are
- **HERE WeGo** for navigation
- the **Nova Launcher** as a replacement for the default Pixel Launcher home screen and
- **dynamicSpot**, an app to emulate Apple's Dynamic Island when recieving a notification.

All of them are installed via the Aurora Store and I can't recommend them enough :). Read more about all of these apps [here](https://github.com/diam0ndkiller/degoogle/blob/main/foss%20apps.md)
## Drawbacks
After installing all the apps, I went on to uninstalling all the Google apps **and services**. This means, there are no Google Play Services on this device, which CAN result in some apps from the Aurora Store not working. Also I have removed the Google Play Store and in the replacement, the Aurora Store, you can't pay for apps. So decide which features you need and check if you apps still work after a full de-Googleing.
## Screenshots
Here you can see all the installed apps. With the ability to change every single SimpleMobileTool's app icon color I think they look A LOT better than the Google apps:
